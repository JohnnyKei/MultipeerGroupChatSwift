# MultipeerGroupChatSwift
This repository is my test to write in Swift.<br>
And I want to try to use MultipeerConnectivity framework.

I think some interesting ideas flow to use MultipeerConnectivity framework.

[Here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/MultipeerGroupChat/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40013691) is Apple sample code.
This sample is written in Objective-C.<br> So I rewrite in Swift to understand how MultipeerConnectivity framework works.
